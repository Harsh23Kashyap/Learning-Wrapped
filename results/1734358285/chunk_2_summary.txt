The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was revealed to the world in 1924, following excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.  John Marshall's announcement launched the study of this ancient civilization.  Key sites like Harappa, excavated by Daya Ram Sahini in 1921, yielded remarkable artifacts.  Located on the Ravi River, Harappa's discoveries included sandstone statues showcasing detailed human anatomy, granaries, and even a bullock cart, providing glimpses into the IVC's sophisticated urban planning and daily life.  These finds significantly advanced our understanding of this fascinating prehistoric culture.
