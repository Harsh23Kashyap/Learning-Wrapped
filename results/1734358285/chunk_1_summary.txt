The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished in present-day Pakistan and northwest India around 2500 BC.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations (alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China), the IVC boasted advanced city planning, sophisticated sanitation systems, and a unique script yet to be deciphered.  Discovered in the 1920s, its remains offer a glimpse into a remarkably organized and technologically advanced society that predates many other known civilizations.  Further archaeological research continues to unravel the mysteries of this fascinating culture.
