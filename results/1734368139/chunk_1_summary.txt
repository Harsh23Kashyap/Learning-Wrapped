The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is Earth's continuous movement of water.  This never-ending process, billions of years in the making, resembles a giant circle.  Water evaporates from bodies of water and land, including through plant transpiration (a process similar to human perspiration).  This water vapor condenses into clouds, eventually falling as precipitation (rain, snow, etc.),  before collecting again in rivers, lakes, and oceans, restarting the cycle.
