Water constantly cycles through the environment.  Warm air holds water vapor, which condenses into liquid when it touches a cold surfaceâ€”like the water droplets on a cold glass.  This condensation, on a larger scale, forms clouds.  When clouds become saturated, precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) occurs, returning water to the earth.  Much of the Earth's water remains stored in oceans, ice, and groundwater, participating less actively in this continuous cycle.
