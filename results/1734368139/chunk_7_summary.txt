The text covers basic water cycle concepts.  It tests understanding of key terms: evaporation (water turning to vapor), convection (heated air rising), precipitation (water falling from clouds), and collection (water accumulating). A multiple-choice question identifies the ocean's vast water storage (96%).  The final instruction, to create a song or rap about the water cycle, encourages creative expression of the learned concepts.  The overall focus is on reinforcing knowledge of the water cycle's processes and Earth's water distribution.
