This activity explores the water cycle, using videos as learning aids ("Cycle Song" and "The Water Cycle").  Students complete a short quiz identifying the four stages of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection), its alternative name (hydrologic cycle), and defining transpiration (water loss from plant leaves).  The activity encourages independent learning while providing options for adult assistance.  Engaging with the videos enhances understanding of this fundamental environmental process.
