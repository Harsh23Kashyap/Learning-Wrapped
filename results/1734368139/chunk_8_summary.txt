The water cycle is a continuous journey of water through Earth's systems.  It begins with evaporation, where the sun's heat transforms water into vapor. This vapor rises, cools, and condenses into clouds through a process called condensation.  Precipitation occurs when water droplets in clouds become too heavy and fall as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This water then flows across the land as surface runoff, replenishing rivers and lakes, or seeps into the ground as groundwater, eventually returning to the oceans and starting the cycle anew.  The cycle is crucial for sustaining life and regulating Earth's climate.
