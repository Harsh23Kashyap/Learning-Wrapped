The water cycle relies on evaporation to lift water vapor into the atmosphere.  Convection then plays a crucial role:  heated air rises, carrying water vapor.  As this air cools, condensation occurs, forming clouds.  This process mirrors everyday observations, like water condensing on a cold glass on a warm day.  Essentially, heat drives the upward movement of water vapor, while cooling triggers its transformation back into liquid water in the clouds.
