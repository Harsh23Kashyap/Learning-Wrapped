Earth's water is predominantly stored in the vast oceans (96%), though this saltwater is undrinkable.  Fortunately, freshwater vital for life is also stored in various locations:  lakes, glaciers, snow caps, rivers, and underground aquifers.  These freshwater sources are crucial for sustaining ecosystems and human needs. Understanding the distribution of water across these reservoirs is essential for effective water management and conservation.
