The water cycle, a magical process, involves four key stages: evaporation, convection, precipitation, and collection.  Evaporation occurs when the sun heats water bodies, turning it into vapor that rises into the atmosphere.  Transpiration, the release of water vapor from plants, contributes significantly to this process.  Convection involves the movement of this water vapor.  Precipitation occurs when the vapor cools and condenses, falling as rain, snow, or hail. Finally, collection sees this water gather in rivers, lakes, and oceans, restarting the cycle.
