The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished in present-day Pakistan and western India around 2500 BC.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations, alongside those of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, the IVC boasted impressive city planning and sophisticated infrastructure.  Discovered in the 1920s by the Archaeological Department of India, the IVC remains a source of ongoing research, revealing insights into early urban life in South Asia.  Its advanced societal organization and unique culture continue to fascinate historians and archaeologists.
