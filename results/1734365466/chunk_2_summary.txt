The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was unveiled in the 1920s, beginning with the excavation of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.  John Marshall's 1924 announcement brought this ancient civilization to global attention.  Key sites like Harappa, excavated by Daya Ram Sahini in 1921, yielded remarkable artifacts. Located on the Ravi River, Harappa revealed sandstone statues showcasing detailed human anatomy, along with granaries and even a bullock cart, offering glimpses into the sophisticated life of the IVC.  These discoveries transformed our understanding of ancient South Asia.
