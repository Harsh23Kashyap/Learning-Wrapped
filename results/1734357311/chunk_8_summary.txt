Harappan cities, featuring a striking grid system, were divided into two distinct sections: a citadel, likely for the elite, and a lower town for commoners residing in brick houses.  Granaries were a key feature, highlighting the importance of food storage.  The sophisticated use of burnt bricks, unlike the primarily sun-dried bricks of contemporary Egypt, showcases the advanced technology of the Harappan civilization. This urban planning demonstrates a high level of societal organization and engineering prowess.
