Harappan civilization was remarkably skilled in crafts.  Evidence shows sophisticated masonry, boat-building, and the production of beads, seals, and terracotta objects.  Goldsmiths crafted jewelry using precious metals and stones, while potters utilized the wheel to create distinctive, glossy pottery.  While few written records survive, the range and quality of their craftsmanship reveal a highly organized and advanced society.
