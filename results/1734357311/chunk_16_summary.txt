Theories on Harappan society are divided: some propose a completely egalitarian structure with no rulers, while others suggest multiple rulers, one for each urban center.  Religious practices, evidenced by numerous terracotta figurines of women, reveal a strong emphasis on a fertility goddess, mirroring ancient Egyptian beliefs.  The depiction of a plant sprouting from a woman's embryo underscores the earth's sacred, life-giving role in Harappan culture.  The lack of centralized authority remains a key point of debate surrounding this ancient civilization.
