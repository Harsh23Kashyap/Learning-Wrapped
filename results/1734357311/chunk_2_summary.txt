The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), a remarkable ancient society, was unveiled in the 1920s through excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.  John Marshall's 1924 announcement brought this lost civilization to global attention.  Key sites like Harappa, excavated by Daya Ram Sahni in 1921, yielded significant artifacts including sandstone statues depicting human anatomy, granaries, and even a bullock cart, providing invaluable insights into the IVC's sophisticated urban planning and technology.  These discoveries revolutionized our understanding of ancient South Asia.
