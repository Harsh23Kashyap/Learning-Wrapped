The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished in present-day Pakistan and northwestern India around 2500 BC.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, the IVC boasted impressive urban planning and sophisticated infrastructure. Discovered in the 1920s by the Archaeological Department of India, its advanced features, including standardized weights and measures, and sophisticated drainage systems, continue to fascinate researchers and highlight its significant contribution to early human civilization.  Further research is ongoing to uncover more about this enigmatic culture.
