The Indus Valley Civilization, flourishing around 1800-1700 BC, mysteriously declined, yet its influence persisted.  Archaeological evidence reveals a Late Harappan culture lasting until 900 BC.  Remarkably advanced for its time, the civilization is renowned for its sophisticated urban planning.  Cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro boasted citadels and meticulously designed streets, showcasing a level of societal organization rarely seen in contemporary cultures.  The reasons for its decline remain a subject of ongoing research.
