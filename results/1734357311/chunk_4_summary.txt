Archaeological discoveries significantly expanded our understanding of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Sites like Kalibangan (1935) revealed antelope remains near the Indus River, while Ghaggar River excavations at Kalibangan (1953) unearthed fire altars and camel bones.  Lothal (1953) showcased the world's first man-made dockyard and evidence of rice cultivation.  Surkotada (1964) contributed horse bone discoveries, and Banawali (1974) provided evidence spanning both pre- and Harappan periods.  Dholavira (1985), located in Gujarat, further enriched our knowledge of this ancient civilization's sophisticated urban planning and culture.  These findings, spanning decades of excavation, paint a vivid picture of the Indus Valley Civilization's complexity and geographical extent.
