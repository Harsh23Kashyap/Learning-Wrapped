The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) spanned three phases: Early Harappan (3300-2600 BCE), Mature Harappan (2600-1900 BCE), and Late Harappan (1900-1300 BCE).  The earliest phase, linked to the Hakra Phase in the Ghaggar-Hakra River valley, saw the emergence of the Indus script around 3000 BCE.  Evidence suggests a centralized authority and increasing complexity, particularly in water management systems, as seen in reservoirs and water harvesting techniques in regions like the Rann of Kachchh.  Further research continues to unravel the mysteries of this ancient civilization.
