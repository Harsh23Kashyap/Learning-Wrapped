The Indus Valley Civilization, evidenced by archaeological finds, was remarkably advanced in agriculture.  They cultivated wheat, barley, and millets, even pioneering cotton production.  While grains reveal agricultural prevalence, reconstructing specific practices remains challenging.  Depictions on seals and sculptures suggest oxen were used for plowing, showcasing their sophisticated understanding of animal labor.  The civilization's settlements were strategically located, reflecting a complex and organized society reliant on its agricultural successes.
