The Indus Valley Civilization, initially seen in sites like Kot Diji, evolved from early farming communities to large urban centers by 2600 BC.  Settlements like Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, and Lothal flourished, exhibiting sophisticated trade networks and agriculture.  Crops like peas, sesame, dates, and cotton were cultivated. This mature Harappan phase, characterized by impressive urban planning, eventually showed signs of decline, marking a pivotal period in South Asian history.
