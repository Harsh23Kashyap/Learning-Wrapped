The Indus Valley Civilization remains shrouded in mystery due to the undeciphered Indus script.  The absence of temples refutes theories of priestly rule, suggesting instead a potential merchant elite held power.  However, definitive evidence of a central authority or ruling class is lacking in the archaeological record, leaving the nature of the Indus state and its institutions a compelling enigma for researchers.  Further investigation is crucial to unlock the secrets of this ancient civilization.
