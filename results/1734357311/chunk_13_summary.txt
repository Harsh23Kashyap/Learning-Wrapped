Master bronze-smiths, utilizing copper from Rajasthan and possibly tin from Afghanistan, crafted sophisticated objects.  Textile production is evidenced by discovered impressions.  Remarkable brick structures highlight advanced bricklaying techniques, showcasing the Harappans' technological prowess and complex societal organization.
