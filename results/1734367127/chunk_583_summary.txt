The text describes a reproducing kernel, denoted as *k*, within a Hilbert space.  A bilinear, symmetric, positive semi-definite inner product <f,g> is defined, showing independence from a variable *j*.  A key property is that the inner product of a function *f* and the kernel *k(Â·,x)* equals *f(x)*.  This "reproducing property," along with equation (6.16), which illustrates the kernel's self-reproducing nature, establishes *k* as a reproducing kernel.  The text highlights the significance of this kernel in the context of Hilbert spaces.
