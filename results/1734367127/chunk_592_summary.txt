The text describes a method for maximizing the margin in a machine learning classification problem.  It aims to find optimal weights (w) and bias (b) for a linear classifier by solving a constrained convex optimization problem.  The constraint,  `yi(hw;xii+b) â‰¥ 1`, ensures sufficient separation between data classes.  The objective is to minimize the norm of the weight vector (||w||), effectively maximizing the margin between classes while satisfying the constraints.  This formulation guarantees a unique solution due to the convex nature of the problem.
