The text describes a modification to a support vector machine (SVM) optimization problem.  The original problem allowed arbitrarily large slack variables (ξᵢ), rendering it ineffective.  To address this, a penalty term (C∑ξᵢ) is added to the objective function (7.5a), minimizing both the weight vector's norm and the sum of slack variables. This creates a "soft margin" classifier (7.5a-c), allowing for some misclassifications while penalizing their magnitude, controlled by parameter C.  The introduction of Lagrange multipliers (βᵢ and μᵢ) is mentioned but not detailed.
