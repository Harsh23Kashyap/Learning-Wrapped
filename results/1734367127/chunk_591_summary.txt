The text describes a binary classification problem where the goal is to find a linear decision boundary (a line) separating two classes of data points (diamonds and circles).  This boundary is defined by parameters 'w' and 'b'.  The objective is to maximize the marginâ€”the distance between the boundary and the closest data points.  The text mentions normalizing (w,b) to ensure the minimum distance to the boundary is 1, making the margin inversely proportional to the magnitude of 'w'.  Essentially, it's about finding the best-fitting line to optimally separate two groups of data.
