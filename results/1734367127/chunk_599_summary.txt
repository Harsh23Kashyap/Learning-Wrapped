Figure 7.2 illustrates three scenarios in Support Vector Classification based on the output  `yi(hw;xi+b)`.  Points correctly classified have `yi(hw;xi+b) > 1` (black).  Support vectors lie precisely on the margin with `yi(hw;xi+b) = 1` (blue).  Points incorrectly classified, or margin errors (red), have `yi(hw;xi+b) < 1`, resulting in a positive slack variable (ξi > 0) and a maximum penalty (λi = C).  The KKT conditions dictate these relationships between classification outcome, slack variables, and penalty parameters.
