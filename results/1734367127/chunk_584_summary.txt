The text describes the construction of a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).  Starting with a positive semi-definite kernel function k(x,x₀),  it shows that the inner product <f, k(.,x)> defines a valid dot product for functions f.  Crucially,  ||f||² ≤ k(x,x) ||f||² implies that  ||f||=0 only if f=0.  This allows the completion of the function space in the corresponding norm, resulting in a full-fledged Hilbert space – the RKHS – characterized by its reproducing kernel.
