Different loss functions yield diverse regression estimators.  Squared loss produces penalized least squares, while Laplace loss results in penalized least absolute deviations.  Huber's loss blends these two, and the versatile pinball loss, parameterized by τ (0 ≤ τ ≤ 1), estimates τ-quantiles. Notably, a pinball loss with τ = 0.5 is essentially a scaled Laplace loss.  The choice of loss function significantly impacts the resulting estimator's properties and robustness.
