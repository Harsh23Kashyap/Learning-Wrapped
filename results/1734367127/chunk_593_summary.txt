Support Vector Classification (SVC) aims to find the optimal hyperplane separating data points.  Equation (7.4) assumes linearly separable data, creating a "hard margin" classifier.  However, for non-separable data, this equation has no solution.  To address this, the text introduces non-negative slack variables, relaxing the constraints and allowing for a more flexible, "soft margin" classifier that can handle overlapping data points.  This adaptation makes SVC more robust to real-world data complexities.
