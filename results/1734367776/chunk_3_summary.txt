The water cycle relies on evaporation to lift water vapor into the atmosphere.  Convection then plays a crucial role: heated air rises, carrying water vapor.  As this air cools, condensation occurs, forming clouds.  This process is easily demonstrated by observing water condensing on a cold glass on a warm day â€“ a miniature version of the larger atmospheric cycle.  Evaporation and convection, together with condensation, continuously move water between the earth and the sky.
