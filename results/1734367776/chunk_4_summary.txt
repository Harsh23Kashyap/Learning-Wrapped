Water constantly cycles through the Earth.  Condensation, a key part of this cycle, occurs when warm, water-vapor-filled air touches a cold surface, causing the vapor to transform into liquid waterâ€”like dew on a glass.  Precipitation happens when condensed water in clouds becomes too heavy, leading to rain, snow, hail, or sleet.  Finally, much of the Earth's water remains relatively static, outside the active water cycle for extended periods.
