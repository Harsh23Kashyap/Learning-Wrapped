This activity explores the water cycle using two linked YouTube videos ("Cycle Song" and "The Water Cycle").  Students then complete a short quiz reinforcing key concepts.  The quiz prompts them to name the four stages of the water cycle, identify its alternative name (hydrological cycle), and define transpiration (water loss from plant leaves).  The activity combines engaging visuals with straightforward knowledge assessment, making learning about the water cycle fun and interactive.
