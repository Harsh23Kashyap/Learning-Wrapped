The water cycle, Earth's natural recycling system, is a continuous journey of water through various stages.  It begins with evaporation, where the sun's heat transforms water into vapor. This vapor rises and cools, forming clouds through condensation.  Precipitation then occurs, releasing water back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.  This water flows over land as surface runoff, replenishing rivers and lakes, or seeps into the ground as groundwater.  Finally, the water either evaporates again, starting the cycle anew, or is absorbed by plants, eventually returning to the atmosphere through transpiration. This dynamic process sustains all life on Earth.
