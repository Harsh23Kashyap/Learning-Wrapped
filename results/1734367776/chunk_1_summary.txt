The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is Earth's continuous, never-ending journey of water.  For over four billion years, water has been recycled through a circular process involving evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.  Plants even participate, releasing water through transpiration, similar to human perspiration.  This vital cycle sustains all life on Earth, constantly moving and renewing our planet's precious water resources.
