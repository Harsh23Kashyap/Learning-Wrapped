Earth's water is predominantly stored in the vast oceans, holding about 96% of the total.  While undrinkable, this salty water contrasts with the freshwater reserves crucial for life.  These freshwater sources include lakes, glaciers, snow, rivers, and underground groundwater.  Understanding this distribution is key to appreciating the planet's water cycle and the importance of conserving this precious resource.
