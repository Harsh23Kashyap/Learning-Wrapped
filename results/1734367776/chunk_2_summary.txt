The water cycle, a magical process, involves four key stages: evaporation, convection, precipitation, and collection.  Evaporation occurs when the sun heats water bodies, transforming it into vapor that rises into the atmosphere.  This vapor, along with water released by plants through transpiration, forms clouds via convection (air movement).  Precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) then returns water to the Earth, finally collecting in rivers, lakes, and oceans, restarting the cycle.
