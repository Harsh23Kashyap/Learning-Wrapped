The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was unveiled in the 1920s, starting with excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.  In 1924, John Marshall declared the discovery of this ancient civilization to the world.  Early excavations, like those led by Daya Ram Sahini at Harappa (located on the Ravi River), unearthed remarkable artifacts.  These included sandstone statues showcasing sophisticated human anatomy, granaries demonstrating advanced storage techniques, and even a bullock cart, revealing a complex and organized society.  These finds dramatically altered our understanding of ancient South Asian history.
