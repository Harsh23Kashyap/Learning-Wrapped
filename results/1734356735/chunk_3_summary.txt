Mohenjo-daro, a major Indus Valley Civilization site discovered in 1922, boasted impressive structures like a Great Bath and granary, alongside artifacts such as a bronze dancing girl and the Pasupati seal.  Other significant sites, including Sutkagendor (a trade hub) and Chanhudaro (known for bead-making), reveal the civilization's widespread reach and sophisticated craftsmanship.  These discoveries, unearthed in present-day Pakistan, offer invaluable insights into the Indus Valley's urban planning, artistry, and trade networks.  The sites highlight the advanced nature of this ancient civilization.
