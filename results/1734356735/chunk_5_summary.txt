The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), spanning from 3300 to 1300 BCE, progressed through Early, Mature, and Late Harappan phases.  The Early phase, linked to the Hakra phase in the Ghaggar-Hakra valley, saw the emergence of the Indus script around 3000 BCE.  This period, along with the subsequent Mature Harappan phase, showcased centralized authority and growing complexity, evidenced by sophisticated water management systems like reservoirs, even in challenging areas such as the Rann of Kachchh.  The Late Harappan phase marked a transition, signaling a shift in the civilization's dynamics.
