Multiple archaeological sites reveal the extent of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Kalibangan (1935) showcased antelope evidence near the Indus; Ghaggar River excavations (1953) unearthed fire altars and camel bones. Lothal (1953) boasted the world's first dockyard and evidence of rice cultivation.  Surkotada (1964) yielded horse bones, while Banawali (1974) revealed both pre- and Harappan cultural layers.  Dholavira (1985), also in Gujarat, further enriched our understanding of this sophisticated civilization.  These discoveries highlight the widespread reach and advanced features of the Indus Valley Civilization.
