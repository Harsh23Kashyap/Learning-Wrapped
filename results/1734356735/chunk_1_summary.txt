The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished around 2500 BC in present-day Pakistan and northwestern India.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations (alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China), the IVC boasted sophisticated city planning,  remarkable craftsmanship evident in its seals and pottery, and a thriving trade network. Discovered in the 1920s by the Archaeological Department of India, the IVC remains a source of ongoing fascination and research, offering crucial insights into early South Asian history. Its sophisticated urban development and unique culture continue to intrigue scholars and the public alike.
