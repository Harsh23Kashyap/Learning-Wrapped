The water cycle is a continuous journey of water through Earth's systems.  It begins with evaporation, where the sun transforms liquid water into water vapor. This vapor rises and cools, condensing into clouds.  Precipitation occurs when the clouds release this water as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.  This water then flows over land as surface runoff, replenishing rivers and lakes, or seeps into the ground as groundwater, eventually returning to the oceans to start the cycle anew.  This vital process sustains all life on Earth.
