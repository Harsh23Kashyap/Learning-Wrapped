Water mysteriously appearing on a cold glass isn't a leak; it's condensation! Warm air's water vapor cools against the glass, turning back into liquid.  This is part of the larger water cycle:  water evaporates, condenses into clouds (through precipitation as rain, snow, sleet, or hail), and then collects in various forms on Earth.  Much of the planet's water remains relatively static, participating less frequently in this continuous cycle.
