The water cycle relies on evaporation to lift water vapor into the atmosphere.  Convection then plays a crucial role: heated air near the surface rises, carrying water vapor.  As this air cools, the vapor condenses, forming clouds â€“ a process easily demonstrated by the condensation seen on a cold glass on a hot day.  This cycle continuously moves water between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere.
