The water cycle, a magical process, consists of four key stages.  Evaporation, driven by the sun, transforms water from bodies like oceans and lakes into vapor, rising into the atmosphere.  This vapor, along with water released by plants through transpiration, contributes to the cycle.  Convection then moves this moisture.  Precipitation occurs when the vapor cools and condenses, falling as rain or snow. Finally, collection gathers this water back into rivers, lakes, and oceans, restarting the cycle.
