This text covers basic water cycle concepts.  It tests knowledge by matching terms like evaporation (sun heating water into vapor), convection (heated air rising), precipitation (water condensing and falling), and collection (water storage).  A multiple-choice question asks the percentage of Earth's water in oceans (96%). Finally, it prompts the creation of a song or rap about the water cycle â€“ a fun way to reinforce learning. The focus is on understanding the movement and storage of water on Earth.
