The water cycle, Earth's continuous water journey, begins with evaporation, where the sun transforms water into vapor.  This vapor rises and cools, condensing into clouds.  Precipitation, in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail, then returns water to the Earth's surface.  This water flows over land as surface runoff, feeding rivers and streams, eventually reaching oceans and lakes.  Some water seeps into the ground, becoming groundwater, which can later resurface or replenish underground aquifers.  The cycle then repeats endlessly, driven by solar energy, sustaining all life on our planet.
