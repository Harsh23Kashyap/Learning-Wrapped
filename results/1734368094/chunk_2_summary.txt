The water cycle, a magical process, involves four key stages.  Evaporation, driven by the sun's heat, transforms water from bodies like rivers and oceans into vapor, rising into the atmosphere.  This vapor, along with water released by plants through transpiration, forms clouds through convection.  Precipitation occurs when this water vapor condenses and falls as rain, snow, or hail. Finally, collection sees this water gather in rivers, lakes, and oceans, restarting the cycle.  Understanding these stages reveals the continuous movement and transformation of water on Earth.
