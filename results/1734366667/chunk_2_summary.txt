The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), a remarkable ancient culture, was revealed through excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, beginning in 1921.  John Marshall's 1924 announcement brought this lost civilization to global attention.  Key sites like Harappa, excavated by Daya Ram Sahini, yielded fascinating artifacts, including sandstone statues showcasing advanced human anatomy, granaries, and even evidence of bullock carts, showcasing a sophisticated urban society.  These findings dramatically expanded our understanding of early human history in South Asia.
