The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, thrived in present-day Pakistan and western India around 2500 BC.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations (alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China), the IVC boasted sophisticated city planning, including advanced sanitation systems.  Discovered in the 1920s by the Archaeological Department of India, its sophisticated urban development and unique culture remain a captivating subject of study, representing a significant chapter in early Indian history.  The IVC's decline remains a topic of ongoing research and debate.
