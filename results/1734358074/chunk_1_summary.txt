The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, thrived in present-day Pakistan and western India around 2500 BC.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations (alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China), the IVC boasted sophisticated city planning, including advanced sanitation systems.  Its discovery in the 1920s by the Archaeological Department of India unveiled a rich culture with a unique writing system yet to be fully deciphered.  The IVC's remarkable urban development and advanced technologies represent a significant milestone in early human history.
