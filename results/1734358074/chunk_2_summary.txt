The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), a remarkable ancient society, was unveiled in the 1920s following excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.  John Marshall's 1924 announcement brought this lost civilization to global attention.  Key sites like Harappa, excavated by Daya Ram Sahini in 1921, revealed fascinating details of IVC life.  Findings included sophisticated urban planning, evidenced by granaries and advanced human anatomy depicted in sandstone statues, hinting at a complex and developed culture along the Ravi River. The discovery of bullock carts further illustrates their advanced technology.
