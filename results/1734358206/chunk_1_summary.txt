The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished in present-day Pakistan and northwest India around 2500 BC.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations (alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China), the IVC boasted sophisticated city planning, including advanced drainage systems.  Discovered in the 1920s by the Archaeological Department of India, the IVC remains a significant historical landmark, revealing a complex and advanced society that predates many others in the region.  Further research continues to unveil its mysteries and remarkable achievements.
