The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), a remarkable ancient society, was unveiled through excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, beginning in 1921.  John Marshall's 1924 announcement brought this lost civilization to global attention.  Key sites like Harappa, excavated by Daya Ram Sahini, revealed sophisticated urban planning, evident in granaries and intricate sandstone statues showcasing advanced human anatomy and even depictions of bullock carts. These finds highlight the IVC's impressive technological and artistic achievements.
