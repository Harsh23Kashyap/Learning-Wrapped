The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), a remarkable ancient society, was revealed through excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, beginning in 1921.  Daya Ram Sahini's 1921 dig at Harappa, located on the Ravi River in present-day Pakistan, unearthed significant artifacts. These included sandstone statues showcasing advanced human anatomy, granaries demonstrating sophisticated storage techniques, and even a bullock cart, highlighting the IVC's developed urban planning and technology.  John Marshall's 1924 announcement brought this lost civilization to global attention.
