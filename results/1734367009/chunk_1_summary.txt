The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished around 2500 BC in present-day Pakistan and northwestern India.  One of the world's four largest ancient urban civilizations alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, the IVC boasted sophisticated city planning, including advanced sanitation systems.  Discovered in the 1920s by the Archaeological Department of India, the IVC remains a significant area of study, offering invaluable insights into early Indian history and urban development.  Its sudden decline around 1800 BC continues to be a subject of ongoing research and debate.
