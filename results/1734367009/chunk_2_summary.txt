The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), a remarkable ancient culture, was revealed through excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, beginning in 1921.  John Marshall's 1924 announcement brought this lost civilization to global attention.  Key sites like Harappa, excavated by Daya Ram Sahini, yielded significant artifacts including sandstone statues showcasing advanced human anatomy, granaries, and even a bullock cart, offering invaluable insights into IVC life and technology.  These discoveries fundamentally reshaped our understanding of early South Asian history.
